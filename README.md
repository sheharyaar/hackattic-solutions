This repository contains my souutions to Hackatti Chanlenges (https://hackattic.com/challenges) in Golang.

Hackattic challenges are really good if you were away from coding for a while and want to get back to it. This is also good for people who are switching to a new language and want to get a good grip on it.

- For most of the solutions you can just run : `go run <solution_file>`
- For folders with go.mod, you may need to run : `go mod tidy` first
- Remember to read the last part of the challenges, about the reasoning behind the challenge.
